# ATM Simulation System (Java)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **console-based ATM simulation system** built in **Java** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
It allows multiple users to log in with a **User ID** and **PIN** and perform common banking operations such as balance check, deposit, withdrawal, and PIN change.  

The program ensures **input validation** and applies **deposit/withdrawal rules** to simulate real-world ATM behavior.
